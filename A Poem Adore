A Poem Adore
To the layers that see
Are Divine and mighty beauty
To what we claim Muse
As our own and go culture
To very delight that's been so frequent
That contribute to the focus
That held on to spending
That need more than money
Then held you higher than grip
That held your house to be exhibit
Where likes to toss the whip
But dare not take it to crack
In which I adore to mean sage
And stand on one occasion
I believe in patrons
I believe in e life
But there's no way about how I feel about your kiss
“It took not even 3 minutes to decide and get response from what I thought could take 3 years to have consciousness”
Poetry pure poetry
Doesn't ever guilt it to me.
Fitness and poetry go hand in hand.
More than sport and poetry I would could say.
There are money traits to a shrug.
I'm luck and not guarded in my curly.
Shadow Spirit cause of ether
Many shouted meanings to be so
I thought sublime and ultimately there
Feed with me desire
And I'll adore your every way.
